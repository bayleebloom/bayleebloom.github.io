description: At least 150 exposures exploring the nature of light and shadow as it
  falls onto objects, landscapes and the world around you. Practice seeing through
  your camera and pay attention to mundane details, such as how the light falls onto
  a railing or the ground. Try hard not to shoot form eye level but to employ unconventional
  angles as you explore how strange the world can look through the camera. This is
  a black and white assignment
