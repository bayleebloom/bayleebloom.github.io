description: Shoot at least 30 images of the same thing several times over to get
  the motion section right. This one requires more time and effort and you will need
  to stabilize your camera. Make sure to look at downgrading criteria at the end of
  this document....for motion you do not have to have identical frames. One should
  simply arrest motion, the other should show long motion over a long exposure.
