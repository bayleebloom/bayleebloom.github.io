description: Objective of this assignment was to create an abstract piece using the
  slip cast molds that the K-State ceramics department provides for their students.
  We had to clean the molds, bind them together so no slip escapes, fill with the
  slip mixture and let them sit to dry so we can take them out. I wanted to create
  a mountain type structure that shows the viewer that the middle piece is broken
  but has been put back together to create a functional object. It shows that even
  though things may be broken they can always be fixed to create something new.
